# Vrinda_store_excel_project
As a skilled data analyst, I successfully conducted an in-depth analysis of Vrinda store's 2022 sales data. By comparing sales and orders, identifying peak performing months, and assessing customer demographics, I uncovered valuable insights. Leveraging this information, I recommended targeted marketing strategies to drive sales growth in 2023, focusing on women aged 30-49 residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, primarily through prominent channels like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
